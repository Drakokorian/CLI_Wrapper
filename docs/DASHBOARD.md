## Implementation Plan Summary for Phases 010–18

The following overview links each upcoming phase to its task identifiers and corresponding high-level plan. Detailed task lists reside in `docs/plans/Phase_010-018_Implementation_Plan.md`.

- **Phase 010 – OAuth Provider Integration** (`PH010-T01`–`PH010-T50`): implement login flows, token storage, and permission checks across all platforms.
- **Phase 011 – Service Health Metrics** (`PH011-T01`–`PH011-T50`): collect uptime statistics, expose metrics endpoints, and add alerts for degraded services.
- **Phase 012 – Advanced Plugin Support** (`PH012-T01`–`PH012-T50`): expand the plugin API for dynamic loading and provide integration examples.
- **Phase 013 – Voice Command Interface** (`PH013-T01`–`PH013-T50`): integrate speech-to-text libraries and map voice triggers to CLI commands securely.
- **Phase 014 – Remote Execution Gateway** (`PH014-T01`–`PH014-T50`): implement secure remote execution endpoints with auditing.
- **Phase 015 – Containerized Deployments** (`PH015-T01`–`PH015-T50`): supply container images, orchestrator scripts, and cross-platform deployment steps.
- **Phase 016 – Cross-Platform Installer Updates** (`PH016-T01`–`PH016-T50`): refresh installers while preserving backward compatibility.
- **Phase 017 – Automated Regression Testing** (`PH017-T01`–`PH017-T50`): add end-to-end test suites and integrate them with the CI pipeline.
- **Phase 018 – AI Prompt Optimization** (`PH018-T01`–`PH018-T50`): tune prompt generation, improve completions, and measure effectiveness.
