# Phase 03: Stunning UI and Themes

## Objective
Give the application an engaging look with responsive layouts and theme support.

## Detailed Steps
- Style the UI using Tailwind CSS and add smooth transitions for component entry and exit.
- Implement a dark and light theme toggle that persists between sessions.
- Add an animated typing effect while responses stream in.
- Organize the layout with:
  - A side panel listing active sessions
  - A model selector that highlights when changed
  - A resource meter showing CPU and RAM usage
- Ensure all components resize gracefully on different screens.
- Configure Tailwind through the Wails asset pipeline with PostCSS.
- Include high DPI font faces and verify color contrast for accessibility.

## Expected Output
The interface feels modern and interactive. Theme preference is remembered, and components respond well to window resizing.

## Dependencies
Completion of Phase 02 for session handling.
