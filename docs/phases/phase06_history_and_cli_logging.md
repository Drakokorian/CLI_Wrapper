# Phase 06: History and CLI Logging

## Objective
Persist every interaction so users can review and reuse previous prompts and results.

## Detailed Steps
- Store each prompt and response pair locally, either in JSON files or an SQLite database.
- Tag records with model name, session ID, timestamp, and success or failure status.
- Provide a UI to browse, search, and re-issue saved prompts.
- Use SQLite FTS5 tables for fast searching across stored prompts and responses.
- Place the history database in the same cross-platform config directory created in Phase 01.
- Support export and import of history data for backup or migration.

## Expected Output
Users have a complete searchable archive of all prompts and responses stored on their machine.

## Dependencies
Requires the resource throttling and telemetry from Phase 05.

## Status
Completed in **Sprint 6**.

## Sprint Plan
- [x] Store prompts and responses in SQLite
- [x] Add search and re-run capabilities
- [x] Support import and export of history
