# Phase 06: History and CLI Logging

## Objective
Persist every interaction so users can review and reuse previous prompts and results.

## Detailed Steps
- Store each prompt and response pair locally, either in JSON files or an SQLite database.
- Tag records with model name, session ID, timestamp, and success or failure status.
- Provide a UI to browse, search, and re-issue saved prompts.

## Expected Output
Users have a complete searchable archive of all prompts and responses stored on their machine.

## Dependencies
Requires the resource throttling and telemetry from Phase 05.
