# Phase 08: Error Security and Polish

## Objective
Harden the application against common security issues and finalize UX details.

## Detailed Steps
- Sanitize all user input before invoking CLI commands to prevent injection.
- Mask API keys or sensitive values if they are ever displayed in the UI.
- Catch and handle all Go subprocess errors, logging failures to `logs.txt`.
- Write comprehensive logs for every error scenario, ensuring no user data leaks.
- Sign application binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions.
- Run static analysis tools like `gosec` and `npm audit` during CI.
- Document the build environment so contributors can reproduce secure releases.

## Expected Output
The app operates safely in production environments with robust error handling and no exposure of secret information.

## Dependencies
Completion of all prior phases.
